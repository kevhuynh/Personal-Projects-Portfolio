Hello! Below are some of my personal projects. More information on my work projects can be found on my resume.

## My projects
### **AR Business Card**

* **Description:** I explored what minimalistic but fun AR effects I could add to a business card to make it more engaging. Built with Meta Spark Studio.

### **BTS/BT21 Gesture Activated AR Stickers**
* **Demo link:** https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lihr2FOicsA
* **Description:** A simple IG filter that has gesture activated AR effects. Built with Meta Spark Studio.
* **Art:** The sticker artwork does not belong to me. I found these online and used them for testing purposes (this filter is not live on Instagram) and because someone I know would like them. Credit to the artwork goes to Brenda/Pekemi who can be found at:

### **Office Tap Adventure**
* **Demo link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH6uQwaPss8
* **Description:** This is one of the first games I made. Built with Unity and C# and made for Android and iOS, Office Tap Adventure is an "office simulation" game built around frantic tapping gameplay. The player must get their work done by tapping on the keyboard panels and filling up the work progress bar. However, hordes of distracting coworkers approach the player from both sides. Coworkers can be shoo-ed away by tapping on them or with other finger gestures. All artwork done by me, and music/sound credits can be found in game.
